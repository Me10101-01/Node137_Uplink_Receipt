## 🔥 Treasury Resilience - Financial Chaos Engineering

This repository now includes the **StrategicKhaos Financial Chaos Engine**, an anti-fragility testing framework for proving system resilience under simulated failure conditions.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run chaos test with default settings
python3 -m treasury_resilience.run_chaos_once

# Run with custom parameters
python3 -m treasury_resilience.run_chaos_once --iterations 100 --chaos-prob 0.15
```

📚 **[Full Documentation](treasury_resilience/README.md)**

### What It Does

- Simulates 5 types of financial system failures (bank freeze, ACH failure, NATS outage, network partition, regulatory hold)
- Tests the 93/7 revenue split (StrategicKhaos ops / ValorYield Engine charity)
- Generates legal-grade anti-fragility reports suitable for the Legal Proof Dossier
- **Sandbox-only**: All events are simulated, no real banking endpoints touched

### Why It Matters

> "We don't just log. We prove we survive chaos."

The chaos engine produces cryptographically-verifiable evidence of operational resilience under adverse conditions, demonstrating that the revenue distribution system can maintain the 7% charitable allocation even during infrastructure failures.
