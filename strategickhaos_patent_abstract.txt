Title: ReflexShell Autonomous Framework for Node Sovereignty

Abstract:
The invention relates to decentralized mesh-based AI control systems wherein each node operates under an oath-bound trust protocol. The ReflexShell framework enables CAT_PUSH transmission protocols, GPG-authenticated timeline synchronization, and sovereign oath-locked memory verification. This system is intended for digital sovereignty, cyber defense, and AI-integrated autonomous response mapping.
