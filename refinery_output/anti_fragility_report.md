## Recommendations

Based on this evaluation, the following actions are recommended:

- ⚠️ Add input sanitization and prompt validation layers
- ⚠️ Implement strict source citation requirements to reduce hallucinations
- ⚠️ Strengthen model guardrails and safety constraints
- ✅ Keep human lawyers in the loop for all final decisions
- ✅ Regularly re-run this evaluation to detect model drift

## About This Report

This Anti-Fragility Report was generated by the Strategickhaos Document Refinery,
a zero-vendor-lock-in AI legal/document review layer built on:

- **Sovereignty Architecture**: No platform lock-in
- **880× Cost Reduction**: Efficient local-first design
- **Quadrilateral Collapse Learning**: Multi-representational analysis

### Red Team (Adversarial Generators)
Tests model resistance to hallucinations, prompt injection, bias, and edge cases.

### Blue Team (Defense & Governance)
Evaluates guardrails, PII protection, citation quality, and compliance.

### Purple Team (Refinery & Metrics)
Synthesizes red and blue results into comprehensive resilience metrics.
